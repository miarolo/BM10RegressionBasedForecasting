# BM10RegressionBasedForecasting

During the minor Data Science, the projectteam had to build a model which would predict the weather. Based on records of the past 10 years.

You had to use Data Science & mining techniques, I choose to do a Regression based forecasting (ARIMA Model).

The webapplicatie wasn't the main task, just something extra so I wouldn't have to show the result in an excel sheet... The code was written in 2 hours while doing some other stressfull schoolstuff, so it isn't real magic!
